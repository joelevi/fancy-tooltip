# Fancy Tooltip
I wanted to make a (relatively) simple rich tooltip. When you hover over a `.hover-object`, the `.tooltip` should become visible. Said tooltip should allow rich (HTML) content, and should act like the cursor has been expanded to show the contents of the tooltip.

[In this example](https://html-preview.github.io/?url=https://github.com/joelevi/fancy-tooltip/blob/main/index.html) I've used FontAwesome for icons and Bootstrap for styles, but you could replace those with your own content if you want.
